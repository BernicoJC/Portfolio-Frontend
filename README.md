# Front End Portfolio

Hi, this is the front end of [my portfolio website](bernicojc.com). Run this to run on local.

```
npm run dev
```

Furthermore, it should have an .env file that's not included here.

This project is a full stack development of a portfolio website utilizing ReactJS frontend and Python Flask backend. This is where I store my projects and to introduce myself to the world about my skills and what I do. I display my software projects and other development projects. Furthermore, I also display my resume here, and it uses SQLAlchemy for its database on the feedback forms and its projects.
